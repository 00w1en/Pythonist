# Pythonist
I often thought about learning to play the piano, but I told myself it was too time-consuming and difficult. So, I created Pythonist - a tool that plays MIDI files on online piano sites.

### How to start
1. Get the MIDI files with the melodies you want to play, or use the ones I used for testing.
2. Open one of these piano sites:
   - https://www.onlinepianist.com/virtual-piano
   - https://virtualpiano.net
3. Run the program and specify the path to the MIDI file (or drag it in from your file explorer).
4. Set the delay time before the program starts, during which you need to ensure the browser window with the site is active.
5. Enjoy!

A C++ version is also available: [plusist](https://github.com/00w1en/plusist).

**P.S.** To end the program, press `Backspace`.
