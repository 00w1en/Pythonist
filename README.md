# Pythonist
I often thought about learning to play the piano, but I told myself it was too time-consuming and difficult. So, I created Pythonist - a tool that plays MIDI files on online piano sites.

### How to start
1. Get the MIDI files with the melodies you want to play, or use the ones I used for testing.
2. Open the `main.py` file, set the path to the MIDI file, and specify the delay time before the program starts.
3. Open one of these piano sites: https://www.onlinepianist.com/virtual-piano https://virtualpiano.net
4. Run the program and make sure the browser window with the site is active.
5. Enjoy!
